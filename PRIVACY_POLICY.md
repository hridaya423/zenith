# Zenith Extension Privacy Policy
Effective Date: January 3, 2025
This privacy policy explains how the Zenith Chrome extension (the "Extension") collects, uses, and protects the information of its users.
## Information Collection and Use
The Extension does not collect or store any personal information about its users. The only information the Extension may access is:

1. New Tab Page Content: The Extension modifies the appearance and functionality of the new tab page in your Chrome browser. It does not collect or store any of the content displayed on the new tab page.
2. Shortcut URLs and Titles: The Extension allows users to add shortcuts to frequently visited websites. The URLs and titles of these shortcuts are stored locally in the user's Chrome browser storage, and are not transmitted or accessed by the Extension's developers, (this is not yet invented)
3. Pomodoro Timer Settings: The Extension provides a simple pomodoro timer feature. Any settings related to the timer, such as the duration of work and break periods, are stored locally in the user's Chrome browser storage and are not transmitted or accessed by the Extension's developers.
4. Task Management Data: The Extension includes a task management feature. Any tasks and related information, such as task names and completion status, are stored locally in the user's Chrome browser storage and are not transmitted or accessed by the Extension's developers.

The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any other information about its users.
## Third-Party Services
The Extension may use third-party services to fetch background images and inspirational quotes. These services are:

1. Unsplash API: The Extension uses the Unsplash API to fetch random background images. The API key used to access the Unsplash API is stored locally in the user's Chrome browser storage and is not transmitted or accessed by the Extension's developers.
2. Quotable.io API: The Extension uses the Quotable.io API to fetch random inspirational quotes. No API key is required for this service.

The Extension does not transmit any user-specific information to these third-party services.
## Data Retention and Security
The Extension does not store any user data on its own servers. All user data is stored locally in the user's Chrome browser storage. The Extension does not have the capability to access or transmit this data.
## Changes to This Privacy Policy
The Extension's developers may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes through the Chrome Web Store listing or the Extension's documentation.
